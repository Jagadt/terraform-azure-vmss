Welcome! 

This repo provides the code that I use for running a demo with Terraform Modules and can go futher into Workspaces.  The code was written around the time v0.12 was released.  I will spend some time updating it in the future.

For now, you can reference my blog: https://azapril.dev/2020/03/16/terraform-modules/

You can also browse straight to the Channel9 video: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/DevOps-Lab/Terraform-Modules-deploying-reusable-code

Happy Coding!
